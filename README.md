**Background**

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset Links to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

**Instructions**

Completed the following steps:

1. Used the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

2. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3. Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.

4. Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

6. Updated all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, created  layout  for the dashboard. An example dashboard is shown as follows

* Data and visualization based on test ID 1253

7. Deployed the app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages.
